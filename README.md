# AMMP Final Project README



## Running Code

To run our project run python main.py from the appropriate directory.

For our project, we have implemented locked-on object stabilization using two approaches. To use the "optical flow" based approach, uncomment the line in main.py that says method = "optical". To use the detection based approach with a cascade classifier, uncomment the line in main that says method="cascade"

INPUT_FILE_NAME and OUTPUT_FILE_NAME both represent the name and directory of the respective input and output files for the program. Using an integer string for INPUT_FILE_NAME uses a camera input to your computer (use "0" for your webcam). 

output_scale is a hyper-paramter for the scale of your output video relative to the scale of the input video. Lower ratios produce lower resolution videos, but tend to have less black boxes around the final output.

### Optical flow

What happens when you run:

After running the code to do optical flow, the video you ran as input will display first. You can press q to quit if you do not want to watch. From there, the first frame of the video will display. You have 10 seconds to click on a point to track/crop around before the code just picks a random point to track. This is because openCV click inputs are weird :(. After you click, the window will disappear until the 10 seconds have ended. Then, a window will display showing the point being tracked from frame to frame. If you press q, the code will stop tracking it. After the point being tracked ends, the video cropped around the tracked point will play and be written to output.py.Â 

To switch between OpenCV optical flow implementaton and our implementation, go to optical.py and uncomment the respective line that stores the points inside the variable new_points.

The window size hyper-parameter for the local window of points that is used to estimate optical flow can also be found in optical.py in the variable window_size for our implementation, and lk_params for for OpenCV's implementation.

### Haar Cascade

What happens when you run:



## Some Results
Our other result gifs were too big to upload to github (but can be observed in our presentation recording!)
